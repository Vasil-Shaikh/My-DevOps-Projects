I did not find the author on LinkedIn or Github to give a shout-out. Do let me know in case you do, would love to tag their account here.



## Goal
Deploy a Modular and Scalable Virtual Network Architecture with Amazon VPC.

## Pre-Requisites
You must be having an AWS account to create infrastructure resources on AWS cloud.

Source Code: https://bitbucket.org/dptrealtime/html-web-app/src/master/

## Pre-Deployment
Customize the application dependencies mentioned below on AWS EC2 instance and create the Golden AMI.

- AWS CLI
- Install Apache Web Server
- Install Git
- Cloudwatch Agent
- Push custom memory metrics to Cloudwatch.
- AWS SSM Agent

## VPC Deployment & Validation

The architecture diagram is attached. In case you are stuck, you can find a little more detailed steps here: https://www.devopsrealtime.com/deploy-scalable-vpc-architecture-on-aws-cloud/

However, if you are working with VPCs, AMI, ASG for the first time, you may soon find that the steps are'nt detail enough, hence, I have tried to include screenshots of every service used in this project.
