## VPC Deployment & Validation

The architecture diagram is attached. In case you are stuck, you can find a little more detailed steps here: https://www.devopsrealtime.com/deploy-scalable-vpc-architecture-on-aws-cloud/

However, if you are working with VPCs, AMI, ASG for the first time, you may soon find that the steps are'nt detail enough, hence, I have tried to include screenshots of every service used in this project.
